## Project Overview

This project contains a set of SQL exercises based on a sample event management database. It covers various SQL querying tasks like filtering, joining, aggregation, and data analysis.

## Project Structure

- `schema/`  
  Contains SQL scripts to create the database schema tables (`create_tables.sql`).

- `data/`  
  Contains SQL scripts to insert sample data into the tables (`insert_sample_data.sql`).

- `ansi-sql-queries/`  
  Contains SQL query files performing exercises on the provided schema and data.

## Exercises Overview

The exercises include tasks such as listing upcoming events, analyzing feedback ratings, identifying inactive users, checking session schedules and conflicts, summarizing event resources, and generating various reports related to users and events.

## How to Use

1. Create the database and run the scripts in the `schema/` folder to create tables.  
2. Load sample data by running scripts from the `data/` folder.  
3. Run the SQL queries from `ansi-sql-queries/` to perform and test the exercises.
